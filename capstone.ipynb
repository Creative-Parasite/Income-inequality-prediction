    "The project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict whether individuals in developing nations earn above or below a specific income threshold, aiming to address the pressing issue of income inequality mostly witnessed in developing nations. By creating a cost-effective and accurate tool for monitoring income levels between census years, this initiative not only offers valuable insights for policymakers to manage income disparities effectively but also carries the potential to significantly contribute to global efforts in mitigating income inequality and fostering a more equitable society.\n",

    "**Goal:** The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount."
